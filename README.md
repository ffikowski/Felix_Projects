# Felix' Projects
This side contains some of mine study related projects.

# [Blood Preasure Data](https://github.com/ffikowski/Blood-Preasure-Data)
- Created and compared were different prediction models in R to predict whether a person has blood preasure or not
- Logistic regression and random forest were the two main modells
- For the random forests the number of trees, maximal depth and the number of variables to possibly split at in each node
- The separation parametes for both models got tuned according to the Accuracy and the ROC curve

# [Big-Data-Analytics (Practical-Tasks)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Big-Data-Analytics-Practical-Tasks-)
- Practical tasks performed in Python which were part of the course Big Data Analytics
- The tasks were mainly employed to a data set of the game FIFA 2020
- Most steps of the Knowledge-Discovery-in-Databases-Process are captured with focus on Data Mining

# [Petri-Dish Simulation](https://github.com/ffikowski/Petri-Dish)
- This is a simulation of a petri dish which is implemented in Python
- The user can determine the size of the dish and also the number of performed time steps
- Three types of bacteria can be placed in the petri dish
- The bacteria are able to perform three actions:
  - Reproduction
  - Movement
  - Destruction of another bacteria

# [Armament-and-Unemployment-Data-Analysis (Bachelor Thesis)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Armament-and-unemployment-data-analysis)
- Bachelor thesis: Analysis of the connection between the armament industry and unemployment in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s
- Digitalization and preparation through Python (take into account that these are my first steps in coding without any preknowledge)
- Application of a Panel-data regression analysis in R
- Result: The Armament Industry had an signifcant influence on the unemployment figures in the respective cities
