# Felix' Projects
This page includes some of the projects I have completed in my studies up to January 2023.

# [Bitcoin Price and Tweets (03/23)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Bitcoin-Price-and-Tweets)
- This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using tweets that contain hashtags like #BTC or #Bitcoin.
- Initially, we assign each tweet a sentiment score using the pre-trained transformer model, finBERT.
- Next, we compute the daily mean sentiment score.
- This mean sentiment score, alongside other variables, is utilized in a VAR time series model to predict Bitcoin prices.

# [Text-as-Data (12/22)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Text-as-Data)
- This includes practical tasks from the 'Text as Data' course.
- The early tasks were primarily focused on preprocessing text data.
- The latter tasks were centered on modelling.
- Models include, for example, clustering models, topic models, and embedding models.


# [Statistics meets Linguistics (01/23)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Statistics-meets-Linguistics)
- This code is partly a result of the identically named university course "Statistics meets Linguistics."
- The goal of this project is to classify if a speaker has a Singaporean or Canadian origin.
- The main emphasis was placed on data preprocessing.
- The classification task was solved using a simple Linear Support Vector Classifier.

# [GDP growth - Nowcast (07/2022)](https://github.com/ffikowski/GDP-Nowcast)
- In this project GDP growth of the U.S. is nowcasted through a time series analysis approach
- u-MIDAS (unrestricted mixed-data sampling) regression model is applied to handle mixed frequency data
- The data is taken from the FRED data base

# [GDP Growth Forecast - A Machine Learning Approach (06/22)](https://github.com/ffikowski/GDP-Forecast-Machine-Learning-Approach)
- In this project, U.S. GDP growth is forecasted using a machine learning approach.
- Different regression trees and a random forest are applied in R for this purpose.
- The data is sourced from the FRED database.

# [GDP Growth Forecast - A Vector Autoregressive Approach (05/22)](https://github.com/ffikowski/GDP-Forecast-Vector-Autoregressive-Approach)
- This project forecasts U.S. GDP growth using a time series analysis approach.
- Different autoregressive and vector autoregressive processes are applied in R for this purpose.
- The data is also taken from the FRED database.

# [Blood Preasure Data (12/21)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Blood-Preasure-Data)
- Various prediction models were created and compared in R to determine if a person has blood pressure issues.
- The two primary models were logistic regression and random forest.
- For the random forests, parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and the number of potential split variables at each node were adjusted.
- The differentiation parameters for both models were tuned according to the accuracy and the ROC curve.

# [Big-Data-Analytics - Practical-Tasks (01/22)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Big-Data-Analytics-Practical-Tasks-)
- This includes practical tasks from the 'Big Data Analytics' course, performed in Python.
- The tasks were primarily conducted on a dataset from the FIFA 2020 game.
- Most steps of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases process are covered, with a focus on Data Mining.

# [Petri-Dish Simulation (08/21)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Petri-Dish)
- This is a simulation of a petri dish which is implemented in Python
- The user can determine the size of the dish and also the number of performed time steps
- Three types of bacteria can be placed in the petri dish
- The bacteria are able to perform three actions:
  - Reproduction
  - Movement
  - Destruction of another bacteria

# [Armament-and-Unemployment-Data-Analysis - Bachelor Thesis (09/20)](https://github.com/ffikowski/Armament-and-unemployment-data-analysis)
- Bachelor thesis: Analysis of the connection between the armament industry and unemployment in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s
- Digitalization and preparation through Python (take into account that these are my first steps in coding without any preknowledge)
- Application of a Panel-data regression analysis in R
- Result: The Armament Industry had an signifcant influence on the unemployment figures in the respective cities
